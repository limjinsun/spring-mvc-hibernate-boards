## Spring MVC CRM Software project

Java Spring Framework - Web application CRM software
This project was built to demonstrate how Java spring-framework and hibernate can be used in a real-world situation. Java spring framework has almost every functionality web application required from user-login handling to ORM(Object Relation Management) for a database. Through this project, I would like to show how each module can be used for the purpose respectively.
